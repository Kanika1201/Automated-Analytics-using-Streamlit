# Automated-Analytics-using-Streamlit

This project is created to enable users to get predictions and perform automated analytics on their diabetes datasets.

The tool enables users to do the following:
1. Manually input 
2. Upload a CSV file
3. Select the ML Model to be used for making predictions

## 1. Manual Input
In this case, a specific user's demographic and medical factors are sent as input in the tool. Predictions will be made based on our 6 pre-trained ML Models and displayed on the screen whether the user has diabetes or not.
User has the option to select the ML Model to be used for prediction.

## 2. Upload CSV File
This option allows users to upload a CSV file with their demographic and medical history to predict diabetes for every row. It also lets users conduct analytics on their initial uploaded dataset and on the model predictions received from the pre-trained models.
